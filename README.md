===============

What's this?
------------
A script to remove (delete) "sidecar" JPEG files.


Description
-----------
A sidecar jpeg file is a file which has the same name as a paired RAW image file
which is generated by digital cameras or RAW development softwares. Note that
JPEG files which is a master image will not be targeted so this script only
targets JPEG files which can be regenerated by RAW development process.

For example, if there are directories and image files as below:

    2014-03-07 Tokyo/_3070001.jpg
                    /_3070001.ORF
                    /DSCN0186.jpg
    2014-03-08 Yokohama/_3090001.jpg
                       /_3090002.ORF

executing this script will remove `2014-03-07 Tokyo/_3070001.jpg` only.
